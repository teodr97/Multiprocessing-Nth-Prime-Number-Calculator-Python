A program in Python 3.8.5 that calculates the Nth prime number using multiple processes.

Made by Dragon Octavian-Teodor. If you want to use this elsewhere, please credit me before

This is my first complete attmept at making a program that calculates
the first 'N' prime numbers using more than one process. Please tell me if
you find anything wrong in here or if you encounter any problems and I'll
try to find a solution. I made this as a learning project.

Modules & packages imported within the project:
- multiprocessing
- math
- time
- sys
- queue
- os (though not used - maybe I'll remove the line later)
